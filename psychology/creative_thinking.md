## 这篇文章的主要内容是什么

- Scarcity of Creativity

> A very small percentage of the population produces the greatest proportion of the important ideas.

- Turing's Analogy between human brain and uranium

> The human brain, if it is below the critical lap and you shoot one neutron into it, additional more would be produced by impact.
> It leads to an extremely explosive of the issue, increase the size of the uranium.
> Turing says this is something like ideas in the human brain

- 3 Basic Requirements for Creativity
  - Training and experience
  - A certain amount of intelligence or talent
  - Motivation
    - Curiosity
    - Constructive Dissatisfaction
    - Pleasure in seeing net results

> My feeling is that a good scientist has a great deal of what we can call curiosity.
> He wants to know the answers.
> He’s just curious how things tick and he wants to know the answers to questions.
>
> I mean a constructive dissatisfaction.
> The idea could be expressed in the words: 
> This is OK, but I think things could be done better.
> I think there is a neater way to do this.
> I think things could be improved a little.
>
> And another thing I would put down here is the pleasure in seeing net results or methods of arriving at results needed, designs of engineers, equipment, and so on.
> I get a big bang myself out of providing a theorem.
> And I get a big kick out of seeing a clever way of doing some engineering problem,
> a clever design for a circuit which uses a very small amount of equipment and gets apparently a great deal of result out of it.
>
> The research man should probably have an extremely strong drive to want to find out the answers,
> so strong a drive that he doesn’t care whether it is 5 O'Clock - 
> he is willing to work all night to find out the answers and al weekend if necessary.

- Tricks for creativity
  - Simplification （化简）
  - Generalization （推广）
  - Seeking similar known problems （类比）
  - Restate it in just as many different forms as you can （八面受敌）
  - Structural analysis （分治）
  - Inversion （倒推）

> Suppose that you are given a problem to solve,
> probably a very powerful approach to this is to attempt to eliminate everything from the problem except the essentials;
> that is, cut it down to size.
>
> It seems to be much easier to make two small jumps than the one big jump in any kind of mental thinking.
>
> Change the words. Change the viewpoint. Look at it from every possible angle.
> After you’ve done that, you can try to look at it from several angles at the same time and perhaps you can get an insight into the real basic issues of the problem.
>
> You are trying to obtain the solution S on the basis of the premises P and then you can’t do it.
> Well, turn the problem over supposing that S were the given proposition, the given axioms, or the given numbers in the problem and what you are trying to obtain is P.

> 不妨把问题想象成一个怪兽布娃娃，我们可以对这个布娃娃做哪些事情？
> 把它压小，这是「化简」；把它拉大，这是「推广」；把它颠倒，这是「倒推」；
> 拿放大镜从各个角度看它，这是「八面受敌」；
> 把它撕成几块，这是「分治」；
> 帮它找一个超人布娃娃，这是「类比」。
