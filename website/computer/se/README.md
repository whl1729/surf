## Documentation

- [Two open source projects with great documentation][d1]
  - esbuild and Redis are two examples of codebases with exceptional documentation.
  - Through their READMEs, changelogs, architecture documents, and code comments, both projects explain their design in such a way
  - that someone new to the codebase can understand where things are, how things are done, and why they are done that way.
