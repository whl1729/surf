## Practice

- [The Great Migration from MongoDB to PostgreSQL][p1]
  - To reduce the learning curve needed to self-host Infisical and, as part of that, we ended up leaving MongoDB in favor of PostgreSQL.
  - MongoDB lacks the support for transactions, clean-up, inconsistent versioning across managed offerings by cloud providers, not to mention issues associated with schema-less database design structure.
