# 点评 [What to do with your computer science career][1]

- Guido 不喜欢做企业家，不想做管理工作（包括招聘、解雇和拉投资等），我也是。

> The question about "9-5" vs. "entrepreneur" is a complex one -- not everybody can be a successful entrepreneur (who would do the work? :-) and not everybody has the temperament for it.
> For me personally it was never an option -- there are vast parts of management and entrepreneurship that I wouldn't enjoy doing,
> such as hiring (I hate interviewing and am bad at it) and firing (too emotionally draining -- even just giving negative feedback is hard for me).
> Pitching ideas to investors is another thing that I'd rather do without.

- Guido 从自己的软件开发工作中获得巨大成就感，因为他写的软件（也就是 Python 语言）正在被大量用户用于开发产品。

> the kind of 9-5 software development jobs I have had are actually (mostly) very rewarding:
> I get to write software that gets used by hundreds or thousands of other developers (or millions in the case of Python),
> and those other developers in turn use my software to produce product that get uses by hundreds of thousands or,
> indeed hundreds of millions of users.
> Not every 9-5 job is the same!

- Guido 还鄙视了一把 入门级的 Web 开发工作，因为这些工作很可能会被自动化。

> Just try to do better than an entry-level web development job;
> that particular field (editing HTML and CSS) is likely to be automated away, and would feel repetitive to me.

- Guido 对 AI 的态度很正面，一点也不担心，反而很欢迎。因为 AI 替代人类做重复性的任务后，人类就可以开始解决新的问题。

> Regarding AI, I'm not worried at all. The field is focused on automating boring, repetitive tasks like driving a car or recognizing faces, which humans can learn to do easily but find boring if they have to do it all the time. The field of software engineering (which includes the field of AI) is never boring, since as soon as a task is repetitive, you automate it, and you start solving new problems.
