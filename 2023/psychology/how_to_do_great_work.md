# 点评 [How To Do Great Work][1]

- 本文要解决的问题：寻找成就伟大事业所需的共同技能

> If you collected lists of techniques for doing great work in a lot of different fields, what would the intersection look like?

## 四部曲

- 成就伟大事业的四部曲
  - 选择一个领域（choose a field）
  - 充分学习以进入前沿领域（learn enough to get to the frontier）
  - 发现问题（notice gaps）
  - 探索有希望的问题（explore promising ones）

- 关于四部曲的一些阐述
  - 不确定想从事的领域，那就猜，猜完之后要努力去做
  - 猜错了没关系，因为积累了领域知识，很多大发现源自注意到不同领域之间的联系
  - 答案看起来很奇怪是件好事，因为伟大事业往往有着奇怪、陌生的迹象。
  - 最强大的三种驱动力：好奇心、满足感、渴望做一些令人印象深刻的事情

> The three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and the desire to do something impressive.
> Sometimes they converge, and that combination is the most powerful of all.

## 第一步：选择领域

- 选择领域是个难题，因为你需要做过（可能要很多年）才知道这个领域是什么以及自己是否合适

- 有些人运气好，一下子能猜对自己适合从事的领域；但更多人需要反复试错。

> Some people get lucky and do guess correctly,
> but the rest will find themselves scrambling diagonally across tracks laid down on the assumption that everyone does.

- 为了选出自己的领域，你需要保持好奇心，尝试各种事情、和各种人交流、读各种书籍、问各种问题。

> So you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to do that is to be curious.
> Try lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, ask lots of questions.

- 一个领域适合你的一些征兆
  - 你对这个领域学习得越多，会觉得越有趣
  - 别人觉得这个领域乏味和可怕，而你很喜欢它

- 不要害怕切换领域

> But fields aren't people; you don't owe them any loyalty.
> If in the course of working on one thing you discover another that's more exciting, don't be afraid to switch.

- 兴奋规则
  - 你想写的最激动人心的故事应该是你想读的故事。
  - 做你自己想要的产品，写你自己想读的故事，建造你自己想用的工具。

- 持续专注于兴趣，别被乱花迷人眼（阻碍因素包括时尚、恐惧、金钱、政治、他人的愿望等）

> Pretentiousness, fashion, fear, money, politics, other people's wishes, eminent frauds.

- 兴趣引导，少些计划
  - 计划的问题：只适用于提前预知的成就，不适用于未知领域的成就。
  - 每一步做最有趣的事情，并给自己关于未来的最好选择。

> At each stage do whatever seems most interesting and gives you the best options for the future.
> I call this approach "staying upwind."

## 第二步：充分学习

- 不要勤奋过头
  - 勤奋过头将会适得其反：工作效率下降、身体变差

- 保留大块的时间去解决难题

- 必要时候骗骗自己
  - 骗自己开始工作：「我只是看看现在取得哪些成绩而已」
  - 骗自己创建新项目：「这个项目能有多难！」
  - 骗自己相信所做的是一个伟大的事业

- 解决拖延症
  - 定期问自己：我现在正在做我最想做的工作吗？
  
> The way to beat it is to stop occasionally and ask yourself: Am I working on what I most want to work on?"
> When you're young it's ok if the answer is sometimes no, but this gets increasingly dangerous as you get older.

- 工作或学习的复利效应

> If you do work that compounds, you'll get exponential growth.
> Most people who do this do it unconsciously, but it's worth stopping to think about.
> Learning, for example, is an instance of this phenomenon: the more you learn about something, the easier it is to learn more.
> Growing an audience is another: the more fans you have, the more new fans they'll bring you.

- 允许偶尔放飞思维
  - 散步、洗澡、葛优躺

> There's a kind of undirected thinking you do when walking or taking a shower or lying in bed that can be very powerful.
> By letting your mind wander a little, you'll often solve problems you were unable to solve by frontal attack.

- 培养你的品味，这样你的目标才会明确

> Consciously cultivate your taste in the work done in your field.
> Until you know which is the best and what makes it so, you don't know what you're aiming for.

## 第三步：发现问题

### 培养创新精神

- 创新不能凭空产生，当你从事某领域时更可能产生新的主意。

- 谈论或书写你感兴趣的事情，更可能产生新的主意。

- 切换上下文（让潜意识发挥作用）

- 在不同话题空间中遨游

> It also helps to travel in topic space.
> You'll have more new ideas if you explore lots of different topics, partly because it gives the angle grinder more surface area to work on, and partly because analogies are an especially fruitful source of new ideas.

- 不要平均用力，应该遵循「能量法则」。

> For example you might give the nth most important topic (m-1)/m^n of your attention, for some m > 1.

- 好奇心本身就是一种创造力。（这个观点第一次听）

> Curiosity and originality are closely related.
> Curiosity feeds originality by giving it new things to work on.
> But the relationship is closer than that.
> Curiosity is itself a kind of originality; it's roughly to questions what originality is to answers.
> And since questions at their best are a big component of answers, curiosity at its best is a creative force.

- 一个同时满足新颖的和明显的主意可能是好主意。

> Seeing something obvious sounds easy. And yet empirically having new ideas is hard.
> What's the source of this apparent contradiction?
> It's that seeing the new idea usually requires you to change the way you look at the world.
> We see the world through models that both help and constrain us.
> When you fix a broken model, new ideas become obvious.
> But noticing and fixing a broken model is hard.
> That's how new ideas can be both obvious and yet hard to discover: they're easy to see after you do something hard.

- 发现新主意的两个方法
  - 比其他人更严格。（发现世界的漏洞）
  - 乐意打破规则。
    - 享受打破规则
    - 无意打破规则（无知者无畏）

- 发现被忽略的好主意的一些问题
  - 对于某个探索者来说什么会是好主意？（这样可以绕过潜意识的监督）
  - 这个领域的人们坚信什么？能否去掉它们？（从掩盖好主意的地方开始行动）

### 发现问题更重要

- 选择问题往往比解决问题更重要
  - 学校没有培养我们提问的能力
  - 保持你的问题，哪怕是很多年前提的问题

> Originality in choosing problems seems to matter even more than originality in solving them.
> That's what distinguishes the people who discover whole new fields.
> So what might seem to be merely the initial step — deciding what to work on — is in a sense the key to the whole game.

- 问题会产生更多问题，最好的问题在解答过程中产生。

### 由小到大、积少成多

> How do you get from starting small to doing something great? By making successive versions.
> Great things are almost always made in successive versions.
> You start with something small and evolve it, and the final version is both cleverer and more ambitious than anything you could have planned.

### 同时利用年轻人和年长者的优势

- 年轻人的优势（精力、时间、乐观、自由）
  - 时间充裕。多学习未知的领域、多构建酷炫的事情
  - 以新人的视角去看任何事情

- 年长者的优势（知识、效率、金钱和能力）

### 克服学校教育的缺点

- 最有价值的知识之一：知道哪些事情不用担心

> One of the most valuable kinds of knowledge you get from experience is to know what you don't have to worry about.
> The young know all the things that could matter, but not their relative importance.
> So they worry equally about everything, when they should worry much more about a few things and hardly at all about the rest.

- 我们的大脑充斥着各种垃圾（坏习惯和错误的观念等）

> You arrive at adulthood with your head full of nonsense —
> bad habits you've acquired and false things you've been taught —
> and you won't be able to do great work till you clear away at least the nonsense in the way of whatever type of work you want to do.

- 克服学校教育的缺点
  - 学校教育鼓励被动性学习
  - 学校教育没有告诉我们如何分辨问题是什么、如何判断问题是否能解决

> The sooner you overcome this passivity, the better. If you're still in school, try thinking of your education as your project, and your teachers as working for you rather than vice versa.

## 第四步：探索有希望的问题

### 专家与同事

- 参加你所在领域的最杰出人才的聚会（可以鼓舞自己，同时增强自信心）

- 选择和最好的同事共同工作
  - 如何识别最好的同事
  
> How do you know when you have sufficiently good colleagues? In my experience, when you do, you know. Which means if you're unsure, you probably don't.
> But it may be possible to give a more concrete answer than that. Here's an attempt:
> sufficiently good colleagues offer surprising insights.
> They can see and do things that you can't.
> So if you have a handful of colleagues good enough to keep you on your toes in this sense, you're probably over the threshold.

### 保持士气，敢于回溯

- 解决难题总是需要回溯。

> Solving hard problems always involves some backtracking.

- 做伟大事业需要使用「深度优先搜索」

> Doing great work is a depth-first search whose root node is the desire to.
> So "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again" isn't quite right.
> It should be: If at first you don't succeed, either try again, or backtrack and then try again.

- 不要抛弃根节点

> "Never give up" is also not quite right. Obviously there are times when it's the right choice to eject.
> A more precise version would be: Never let setbacks panic you into backtracking more than you need to. Corollary: Never abandon the root node.

### 保持好奇心

- 好奇心是最好的向导

> Curiosity is the best guide.
> Your curiosity never lies, and it knows more than you do about what's worth paying attention to.

- 好奇心是伟大四部曲中每一步的要诀

Curiosity is the key to all four steps in doing great work: it will choose the field for you, get you to the frontier, cause you to notice the gaps in it, and drive you to explore them. The whole process is a kind of dance with curiosity.

- 做伟大事业的四大因素
  - 能力、兴趣、努力、运气

> The factors in doing great work are factors in the literal, mathematical sense, and they are: ability, interest, effort, and luck.
> Luck by definition you can't do anything about, so we can ignore that.
> And we can assume effort, if you do in fact want to do great work.
> So the problem boils down to ability and interest.
> Can you find a kind of work where your ability and interest will combine to yield an explosion of new ideas?
