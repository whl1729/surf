# 点评 [Vim Boss][1]

Bram Moolenaar 8月3日去世，neovim 团体为悼念他而撰写此文。

- Bram 从不哗众取宠，也不凭个人喜恶行事。

> He never appealed to sensationalism or personal judgements.

- Bram 面对粗鲁对待时，依然以理服人。

> Even when treated rudely, Bram usually responded only to advance his understanding of a problem to solve.
> Bram was one of those humans quietly providing deep value to the universe, but there was no parade and little celebrity.

- Bram 一直在帮助乌干达的儿童，vim 的启动界面一直显示这么一句话：`Help poor children in Uganda! `

- neovim 继承了 vim 的一些精华
  - 可维护性
  - 规范完整的文档
  - 可扩展性
  - 可嵌入

- Bram 谦虚而幽默，从不自以为是。

> Bram didn’t take himself too seriously. He had his own sense of humor.
