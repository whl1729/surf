# 点评 [King's Day Speech][1]

- 这是荷兰大使馆邀请 Guido 进行的一次 TED 演讲的演讲稿，听众是荷兰和美国的企业家。

- 演讲稿的主要内容
  - Guido 的自传
  - 编程语言的重要性
  - Python 的核心思想

- Guido 的自传
  - 一个 nerd，一个 Geek
  - 1956年1月31日出生，2023年67岁（于我而言是爷爷辈的人物了）
  - 10岁开始捣鼓父母给的一个教学性质的电子工具箱，5年级捣鼓出一个闪光灯
  - 高中继续沉迷电子学，物理课上和同学讨论与非门，物理老师让他们开发一个数字计时器
  - 高中毕业后就读阿姆斯特丹大学的数学专业
  - 大学沉迷编程，折腾科学楼的大型主机，加入大型主机的操作系统组，过于沉迷，导致想辍学，幸好被老师劝阻
  - 26岁从大学毕业，45岁结婚（大牛的人生节奏也很慢嘛，看来我也不用太焦虑）

- 大学编程经历的最大收获：分享的重要性

> But the most important lesson I learned was about sharing:
> while most of the programming tricks I learned there died with the mainframe era,
> the idea that software needs to be shared is stronger than ever. Today we call it open source, and it’s a movement. Hold that thought!

- ABC编程语言设计经历的教训：尽快发布，经常发布

> Just half a decade later, when I was picking through ABC’s ashes looking for ideas for my own language,
> that missing feedback loop was one of the things I decided to improve upon.
> “Release early, release often” became my motto
> (freely after the old Chicago Democrats’ encouragement, “vote early, vote often”).
> And the internet, small and slow as it was in 1990, made it possible.

- 编程语言不仅仅是告诉计算机要做什么

> Typically when you ask a programmer to explain to a lay person what a programming language is,
> they will say that it is how you tell a computer what to do.
> But if that was all, why would they be so passionate about programming languages when they talk among themselves?

- 编程语言还是程序员表达和交流思想的媒介

> In reality, programming languages are how programmers express and communicate ideas —
> and the audience for those ideas is other programmers, not computers.
> The reason: the computer can take care of itself,
> but programmers are always working with other programmers, and poorly communicated ideas can cause expensive flops.

- Python 是一门由社区创造的编程语言

> But I believe the most important idea is that Python is developed on the Internet, entirely in the open,
> by a community of volunteers (but not amateurs!) who feel passion and ownership.

- Guido 因自己是社区的一员而感到快乐（值得细细品味，我有多久没有因自己作为社区的一员而快乐了？）

> I am happiest when I feel that I'm part of such a community.
> I’m lucky that I can feel it in my day job too. (I'm a principal engineer at Dropbox.)
> If I can't feel it, I don't feel alive.
> And so it is for the other community members.
> The feeling is contagious, and there are members of our community all over the world.

- Guido 最喜欢的故事：伊拉克巴比伦大学的学生也在学习 Python

> My favorite story:
> A year ago I spent 20 minutes on a video conference call with a classroom full of faculty and staff at Babylon University in southern Iraq, answering questions about Python.
> Thanks to the efforts of the audacious woman who organized this event in a war-ridden country, students at Babylon University are now being taught introductory programming classes using Python.
> I still tear up when I think about the power of that experience.
> In my wildest dreams I never expected I’d touch lives so far away and so different from my own.

- 一门由社区创造的编程语言因它遍布全球的用户而铸就幸福。

> A programming language created by a community fosters happiness in its users around the world.
