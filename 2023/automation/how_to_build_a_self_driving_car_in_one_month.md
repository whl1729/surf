# 点评 [How to build a self driving car in one month][1]

这篇博客令我深感震撼，作者的学习方法很值得我学习。
目前我采用的学习方法是「线性学习法」，低效且与实践脱节，应该修正为 「V字形学习法」。

- Linear Method of Learning
  - start with the basics
  - build up a general foundation of knowledge
  - and then continue towards finer and finer levels of detail

- V-Method of Learning
  - I start with a specific, well-documented example of my end goal
  - I try understand how this example works
  - For everything I don’t understand about the example, I research the underlying concepts
  - If I don’t understand the underlying concepts, I research the underlying concepts of the underlying concepts, until I feel I’ve exhausted this path
    (either by reaching understanding or by reaching a point of diminishing returns)
  - Eventually, I pigeonhole down enough different paths to start seeing patterns in the important underlying concepts
  - I study these relevant underlying concepts, slowly working my way up the knowledge chain, until I’m back at the level of detail of the original example
  - Finally, I reproduce the example based on my new hierarchical knowledge
